Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby programming language. 
It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what 
every developer needs to get started.
It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks. 

                                            INSTALLATION OF RAILS
Before downloading rails user should have ruby and sqlite3 installed in the system . 
And to check that ruby and  sqlite3 is there or not 
use:-
$ ruby --version
$ sqlite3 --version

To install rails in the system use:- 
$ gem install rails 
after that to check if rails installed in the system:-
$ rails --version 

To create an application of rails in the system
$rails new <appName>
then switch the directery to the <appName>:-
$ cd <appName>

You will find many types of folder in your rails application after creating an app such as:-
app/
bin/
config/
db/
etc

                                            HELLO WORLD

To create a Page use:-
rails generate controller <dirName> <filename>
eg:-
rails g controller Hme index
It will create a file in App > views > Home >index.html.erb
[!Note - Because of .erb extension we can write ruby code in html doc.]
Open index.html.erb and type your html code in the file:-
<h1>Hello World</h1>


To create a index.html.erb file as a root file go to 
Config > routes.rb 
and type root '<dirName>#<fileName>' in between the ...do [] ...end 
eg:- root 'Home#index.html.erb'


[!Note while we will create a new file automatically a new <FolderName>_controller.br file 
will be created in cpntrollers folder and new route will be added in route.rb file or user can 
create the file manually]
